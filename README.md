# JavaScript-to-TypeScript-Transpiler
JavaScript lacks static typing, leading to runtime issues and poor scalability. TypeScript solves this but migrating existing code is tedious. This project builds a JavaScript-to-TypeScript transpiler that reads JS code, infers types, and auto-generates TS code to simplify migration and promote TypeScript adoption.
